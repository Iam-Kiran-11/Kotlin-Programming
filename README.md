----- *CHAPTERS* -----

**KOTLIN** **BASIC**

1. **What is kotlin**<br>
Ans: `Kotlin is a modern language. Apps that are made using this are less likely to crash and are more stable and robust apps for users.`

2. **Use of kotlin in android and server side and multi-platform**<br>
Ans: `Kotlin is a versatile language. It is the officially supported language for android development and used to build apps with less code. Kotlin-based framework provides simple and lightweight APIs for server side applications like web services. Once a code is written it can be used in Android, ios, web, desktop, etc.`

3. **Basic syntax, Data Types and Type Declaration and Variables**<br>
Ans: <br>
*Basic Syntax like:-*
    `fun main() —> program starts from here/entry point of the program.`
    `println() —> prints the output of a program`
     
*Data Types like:-*
    `int —> whole number(e.g. 4 )`
    `Double —> Decimal numbers(e.g. 4.31)`
    `Boolean → true or false`
    `Char → single character (e.g. B)`
    `String → text (e.g. ‘’Hii”)`
     
*Type declaration:-*
    `like “Hello” is declared as string`
     
*Variables:-*
    `val → can’t be changed after assigned`
    `var → can be changed` 

4. **Comments**<br>
Ans: `In kotlin, comments are used to explain the code and make it readable for users/programmers. Types of comments- single line comment, multi-line comment, etc.`

5. **Main function**<br>
Ans: `Main function is a special function in Kotlin programming where the code is written inside the main() function or called from it. Function is 1st defined in a code and it can also require some inputs. Function definition starts with “fun” and the name of that is “main” i.e., fun main().`

6. **Print Statement**<br>
Ans: `Print statement is used to display the output of a code in Kotlin. Two ways to display output:- 1. print() → prints without a new line, 2. println() → prints with a new line.`

7. **Constants**<br>
Ans: `Constants are used to store fixed values in a code that don’t change during programming. Constants are declared using val and const val.`

8. **String, Literals and String Interpolation**<br>
Ans: `String is a sequence of characters enclosed by double quotes. Two types of string literals:- 1. Escaped string → uses special characters like \n(for new line) and \t(tab), 2. Raw string → uses triple quotes “ “ “ to multi-line text without escape characters. String interpolation uses the syntax ‘$’ to interpolate variables directly into strings.`

9. **Readline**<br>
Ans: `Readline (readline() ) is used to take inputs from the users/programmers.`
